# MessengerStatistics

## 💻︎ Contents of the repository :

This repository contains the code of an application that allows you to analyze your Messenger data.

## 🎯 How does it work? 

First, you need to download your Messenger data from your Facebook account settings. Once this is done, you just have to run the code and choose the "messages" folder of your Facebook data. You will then get general statistics and graphs related to your use of Messenger.
If you have already used this application, your summary data will be stored on your computer in a global_stats.json file. You can during another use decide to open this file to recover your statistics faster.

## 🧑‍💻 Proposed statistics: 

You will be able to obtain graphs about:
- your global use of Messenger
- your daily, monthly or yearly use of Messenger
- your most active conversations (with the ability to include or exclude group discussions)

## 💡Possible improvements:

- Provide the opportunity to include or exclude certain individuals from statistics
- Know the people you’ve talked to the most in the last X months

## 💡Examples of the application in operation:
